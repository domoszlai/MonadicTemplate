Monadic templating in C#
==================================

![Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/domoszlai/Monadictemplate?branch=master&svg=true)

## Overview

A C# prototype framework for generating formatted output using distributed generator functions. The framework is based on a technique heavily exploited in the functional programming world, called [monads](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad)
and the [string interpolation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn961160.aspx) feature of C# 6.0.

The templating engine is explained in a series of articles: **Monadic templating in C#** [Part1](http://dlacko.org/blog/2015/11/16/monadic-templating-in-csharp-part-1/), [Part2](http://dlacko.org/blog/2015/11/16/monadic-templating-in-csharp-part-2/).
The repository contains all the source code and examples explained in the articles.
